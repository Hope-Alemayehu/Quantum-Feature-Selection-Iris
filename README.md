## Quadratic Programming Feature Selection (QPFS) on the Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates **Quantum Probability Feature Selection (QPFS)** applied to the **Iris dataset**, implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**. The primary goal of this project is to explore **Quadratic Programming (QP)** concepts and their application in feature selection using quantum-inspired optimization.

### 🚀 Purpose

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. **Learning Quadratic Programming**: Understanding the principles of QP and how it applies to optimization problems in machine learning.
2. **Applying QPFS**: Using QPFS to evaluate feature relevance and redundancy for feature selection, leveraging quantum-inspired methods.

### 📊 Dataset: Iris

The **Iris dataset** is a widely used dataset in machine learning and contains:

- **150 samples** of iris plants across three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*.
- **4 features**:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
- **Target variable**: The species classification.

### 🛠️ Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the Iris dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
   - Standardized the features for consistent scaling.

2. **Calculating Feature Relevance (F)**:
   - Computed the relevance of each feature to the target variable using correlation.

3. **Calculating Feature Redundancy (Q)**:
   - Constructed a correlation matrix to evaluate feature redundancy.

4. **Encoding QPFS Objective Function**:
   - Formulated the optimization problem by combining relevance and redundancy.
   - Encoded the objective into a Hamiltonian representation.

5. **Quantum Optimization**:
   - Submitted the Hamiltonian to the Dirac-3 device using the QCi API.
   - Retrieved and analyzed the optimized solution.
